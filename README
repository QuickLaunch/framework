This rails project framework is based of of Hartl's "Rails Tutorial," specifically the sample_app.  This frameworks includes some, though not all of the excercises recommended in that book.
My intention was to create a platform that contained the necessary elements of most websites.  


Once you fork this repo, be sure to rename the project and use that name to replace the following instances that use the term "framework."

App name
app/helpers/application_helper.rb
app/views/layouts/application.rb:18
rakefile:7
config.ru: 4
config/database.yml: 15, 31, 42
config/environments/development.rb:1
config/environments/test.rb:1
config/environments/production.rb:1
config/environment.rb:5
config/initializers/secret_token.rb:7
config/initializers/secret_token.rb:3 (x2)
config/routes:1
spec/controllers/pages_controller_spec.rb:7, 16


Also, be sure to add your logo and update spec/controllers/pages_controller_spec with it's location.
